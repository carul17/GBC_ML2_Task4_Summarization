“Neural Network is a collection (a network) of neurons whose job is to learn a new thing or a new place or a new process or a new concept.” It would be stupid on my part to start with a definition of Neural Network like how we used to teach adults in college.
What I was actually doing here was teaching her neural network (brain) the features of a lion like exactly how Machine Learning Engineers would train the machine to learn new features.
After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before.
When you see a new object, your brain will ask the neurons, ‘Hey, anybody experienced this before?’ The neurons will say, ‘Yes, I have seen this.’ Certain other neurons will say, ‘No, I have not seen this.’ The neurons that have seen this before, will group together and form logical connections from the past and gives us an object from our memory.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.

I said, “Good Job!” and asked her, “Where’s the tail, baby?” She smiled and drew a tail.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.
It starts with ’N’ and ends with a rhyming sound of ‘ons’ Tanishi: Neurons Me: Good job, baby.
Tanishi: Neuron friends Me: Good.
That was how I ended my Sunday afternoon with my brilliant daughter who can teach other kids what a Meural Metark is.

What I was actually doing here was teaching her neural network (brain) the features of a lion like exactly how Machine Learning Engineers would train the machine to learn new features.
For example, a face object can be seen by neurons as a circle (face) with two smaller circles (two eyes), a line (nose) and a curved line (mouth).
Neurons will look for these patterns (circle, line, curved line, smaller circles and so on).
When something new is heard, or smelled, or seen, or tasted, the neurons will group together to send signals and forms connections with already seen, heard, tasted or smelled neurons.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.

LSA Summary:
------------
As I was lazy and not in a position to move after the big spread, I evaded the chance to play with her by telling her “Papa’s got some work baby.
I saw an opportunity here as a teacher (teaching professional college adults) to simplify the complex problem to a simpler understandable concept for a kid who doesn’t know anything apart from ABC, 1 to 20, Colors and Shapes.
I gave a couple of lectures to make my adult students understand what a Neural Network is when I taught them a mini-Machine Learning course.
The same principle is applied for a song that you hear, a cartoon that you watch, a rhyme that you sing, an animal that you draw, a food that you taste, a flower that you smell and so on.

With a smile, I said slowly, “Its Neu — ral Net — work” She asked, “Papa, What is Meu-ral Met-ark?” At the back of my head, thoughts of me taking days to comprehend what a NN (short for Neural Network) is, how it would work, where it is used, how it is simulating our human brain’s inner workings were going through.
“Neural Network is a collection (a network) of neurons whose job is to learn a new thing or a new place or a new process or a new concept.” It would be stupid on my part to start with a definition of Neural Network like how we used to teach adults in college.
After all, neural network inside our brain helps us to learn new things in our life.
What I was actually doing here was teaching her neural network (brain) the features of a lion like exactly how Machine Learning Engineers would train the machine to learn new features.
After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before.
A dog will have features like face, body, legs, and tail.
A lion will have features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.
Once all the features are there, the neurons will send a signal that the picture you are looking at is a lion and not a dog.
Tanishi: Yes. Me: So, for a dog, the features are face, body, legs and tail.
All neurons work together like your friends and identify lion and dog.
Neural network is a group of neuron friends identifying lions and dogs.

How you learnt it is because of Neural Network inside your brain.” Now, a neural network is a collection of neurons that keeps switching on and off based on things you see, feel, hear and think just like switching on light bulb at our home.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.
Once all the features are there, the neurons will send a signal that the picture you are looking at is a lion and not a dog.
Ultimately, the neurons in your brain tell that it is a lion and not a dog.
When I ask you to draw a dog, what are the features there?
Tanishi: Yes. Me: So, for a dog, the features are face, body, legs and tail.
If I ask you to draw a lion, what are the features?
Once the features are seen and a logical connection is established, neurons signals your brain that it is a lion.
All neurons work together like your friends and identify lion and dog.

Best Method Analysis
===================
After comparing all methods, Gensim provides the best summary for this article because:
1. It preserves the narrative flow of the teaching explanation
2. It maintains the complete conceptual thread from introduction to examples
3. It captures both the technical content (neural network concepts) and the storytelling context (father-daughter interaction)
4. It includes concrete examples (dog vs lion features) that help explain the concept
5. It retains the accessible, conversational tone of the original article while keeping the key technical points
